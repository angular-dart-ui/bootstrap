<p>The <strong>accordion directive</strong> builds on top of the collapse directive to provide a list of items, with collapsible bodies that are collapsed or expanded by clicking on the item's header.</p>

<p>We can control whether expanding an item will cause the other items to close, using the <code>close-others</code> attribute on accordion.</p>

<p>The body of each accordion group is transcluded in to the body of the collapsible element.</p>
